# DYSCO
The goal of this repository is to provide a self-contained framework for
solving combinatorial problems using a relatively new paradigm of algorithms
based on simulating specific dynamical systems which tend to evolve towards 
high-quality solutions.
The _self-contained_ part refers to two things:
- theory supporting these algorithms (in form of a thesis)
- algorithms themselves

## MSc Thesis
My Master's thesis in `.pdf` format is in the `thesis` directory.

## Algorithm
- TODO: This part is in progress... Star the repository to follow up.

The library with algorithm(s) will be in the `dysco` directory.
Scripts for running will be in the `run` directory.
